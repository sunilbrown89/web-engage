Dear Acoount Manager Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. 
I am writing to respectfully request an extension of the deadline for the assignment that is due tomorrow.

I am reaching out to request an extension due to a recent family emergency that has taken up much of my time and attention. 
Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to complete the assignment to my usual standard.

I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, 
but I believe a few extra days would allow me to submit a high-quality piece of work while also attending to my family responsibilities.

I would be grateful if you could grant me an extension of three days. 
I understand that this may not be possible, but I wanted to reach out and ask nonetheless.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration during this difficult time. I appreciate your support and will make every effort to submit the assignment as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Sunil Sahu
